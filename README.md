# WickedOnes

[As announced on the 2024-Jan-07 Kickstarter update.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/banditcamp/wo-ua-hardcover/posts/4001335)

I took Wicked Ones down from DTRPG with the end of 2023, no longer being able to process (the very few) sales from it for tax reasons. I was planning on setting it to free, but realized review bombing had started there. That's okay, I understand why, but I didn't see a reason to leave that up. It'll just get messier.

Instead, Wicked Ones has been set to CC0, meaning it's now in the public domain. It can be freely used, distributed, or even re-sold as you like. The updated wording should be on the updated Wicked Ones v1.4 and Toolkit deck files you can download from your DTRPG library.

The artwork and any associated files are also released into CC0. This does not include War for the Overworld (which is no longer available due to my not holding the copyright) or Undead Awakening and its artwork (which is owned by Cass Rea). Cass is free to distribute or sell Undead Awakening on their own (distributed with Wicked Ones, if they like) as it is his.
